# func2 [![Pub](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/func2.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/func2)

Repository for the func package containing convenience typedefs defining
commonly used function types to make it simpler to define members that return
specific function types.

## This is a fork of the [original func package](https://github.com/dart-archive/func) by the Dart team upgraded to Dart SDK 2.0
